# The Core Story

## Where This Started

I teach in an inner-city charter school.

My students come from different backgrounds, different languages, different levels of stability — and they sit in the same room expected to care about history, systems, and the world around them.

Making that work isn't about charisma or lesson plans.
It's about **designing experiences that hold attention**, explain complexity without talking down, and meet students where they actually are.

If a system doesn't work, you don't get to ignore it.
You see it immediately — in the room.

## The Problem I Ran Into

Most tools weren't built for this environment.

Educational software assumed ideal conditions:

* unlimited attention
* consistent support at home
* students who already felt school was "for them"

That wasn't my classroom.

To make history meaningful, I had to break topics down, rebuild them, and present them in ways that felt alive — systems, conflicts, incentives, cause and effect. When something didn't land, I adjusted in real time.

That process changed how I think.

I stopped asking *"What's the tool?"*
and started asking *"Why does this system fail when reality shows up?"*

## How That Led to Building Systems

I started pulling things apart outside the classroom.

### Machine Learning

I wanted to understand how AI systems actually learn — not just how to use them.

I began training open-source models myself, working directly with base models and fine-tuning them using **CUDA and QLoRA**. I focused on domains that mirror what I taught every day:

* geopolitics
* mathematics
* philosophy

Fields where understanding comes from structure, not shortcuts.

I publish the models because I believe systems should be open to inspection — especially if they're going to influence how people think.

### Markets & Risk

Markets became another classroom.

I build **DEX components**, **crypto and equity trading bots**, and strategy systems grounded in **stochastic calculus**, not indicators. For risk modeling, I use **optimal transport methods** to understand how conditions shift over time.

Markets don't care about intentions.
They reward systems that respect uncertainty.

### Education, Revisited

I didn't leave teaching — I extended it.

I now build **teacher simulations and classroom tools** shaped by real experience: limited time, diverse needs, constant decision-making. Tools that support judgment instead of adding noise.

## What Ties It Together

Teaching in an inner-city charter school forces honesty.

You learn quickly that:

* engagement has to be earned
* explanations have to be clear
* systems have to work under pressure

AI, trading, and education all fail for the same reason when they fail:
they're built without respect for real constraints.

My work is about closing that gap.

## Moving Forward

I'm still teaching.
I'm still building.
I'm still learning.

What I showcase now — trained models, trading systems, simulations — all come from the same place: wanting systems that actually work for the people using them.

If you care about building things that hold up in the real world, I'm open to a conversation.

That's it.
